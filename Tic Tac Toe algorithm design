The TicTacToe class represents the game itself. It has three main attributes: 
board: A 2-dimensional char array representing the game board. 
currentPlayerSymbol: A char variable indicating the symbol ('X' or 'O') of the current player. The constructor TicTacToe() initializes the game by creating a new 3x3 game board using the board attribute, and sets the currentPlayerSymbol to 'X'. It also calls the initializeBoard() method to fill the board with '-' characters. 
The initializeBoard() method fills the board array with '-' characters, representing empty cells. 
The printBoard() method displays the current state of the game board in a formatted manner. It iterates over the board array and prints each element, along with the borders, to create a visual representation of the game board. 
The makeMove(int row, int col) method allows a player to make a move on the game board by specifying the row and column indices of the desired position. It first checks if the specified indices are valid and if the cell is empty ('-'). If so, it updates the board with the current player's symbol and returns true. Otherwise, it returns false, indicating an invalid move. 
The checkWin() method checks if the current player has won the game by examining the game board. It checks for winning conditions in rows, columns, and diagonals. If any winning condition is found, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false. 
The isBoardFull() method checks if the game board is completely filled with symbols. It iterates over the board array and if any empty cell ('-') is found, it returns false. If all cells are filled, it returns true, indicating a tie game. 
This prototype code provides the basic functionality of a Tic-Tac-Toe game, including initializing the board, printing the board, making moves, checking for a win condition, and determining a tie game. However, it does not include a game loop or player input handling. Those components can be added to create a fully interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game.
